        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <ul>
                <li>It seems that the author is just trying to communicate which regions have the
                    highest rates of maternal deaths and investigate which areas of the world have
                    the most severe mortality rate, which is done very clearly and well</li>
                <li>This visualization makes effective use of the pie chart format in
                    order to show the percentage breakdown of maternal deaths by region</li>
                <li>The color palette is aesthetically pleasing, and although the shades
                    of blue used fot Latin America and South Asia look similar, they are
                    separated by the gray of East Asia/Pacific in order to prevent confusion</li>
                <li>Each wedge of the pie chart is clearly labeled with the region name,
                    quantity of maternal deaths, as well as the percentage</li>
                <li>This visualization also has a clear title and disclaimer at the bottom
                    to account for rounding</li>
                <li>The graph is not overly complicated and has a low Lie Factor - that is,
                    information from the data is not distorted by the visualization itself</li>
                <li>There is no excess of ink or design present that obstructs or distracts
                    from the data</li>
                <li>There is no "chart junk," or excess information on the chart that is
                    irrelevant</li>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <ul>
                <li>The author appears to be trying to convey a few ideas: (1) that the global
                    under-five death rate has certainly gone down compared to what it would have been
                    had 1990 levels been maintained, and (2) that there remains more work to be done
                    in order to achieve the 2015 goal</li>
                <li>Like the previous example of a good visualization, this graphic also has
                    a clean format and color palette</li>
                <li>This visualization has a clear key to distinguish the three types of
                    lines on the plot and their individual implications</li>
                <li>This visualization also has a low Lie Factor, as the y- and x-axes have
                    a standard and consistent scale, and the y-axis is based at 0</li>
                <li>This visualization also makes note of important points on the x-axis
                    timeline, such as the date of the graph's creation (2013) as well as the
                    original 2015 under-give mortality goal and projected attainment of that
                    goal</li>
                <li>The Data-Ink ratio is also acceptable - the visualization is a simple line
                    graph, and has no excessive design or imagery so as to confound the actual
                    data</li>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <ul>
                <li>The author is clearly trying to prove that the number of Americans on welfare
                    exceeds the number of Americans who work full time in order to prove that
                    welfare is putting a strain on the American economy</li>
                <li>This visualization is decent in terms of color choice, but it is hugely
                    misinformative due to the truncation of the y-axis</li>
                <li>The Lie Factor of this visualization is incredibly high: on the scale of
                    100 million, a difference of less than 7 million should not create such a
                    discrepancy between the heights of the two bars</li>
                <li>This visualization also fails to take into account the frequent occurrence
                    that people on welfare are also employed full-time, and instead views the
                    two groups as mutually exclusive</li>
                <li>This visualization could be much improved if the y-axis were based at 0 and
                    clearly labeled in order to ensure that the difference between the two
                    values is not exaggerated</li>
                <li>It would also be worthwhile to explore visualization options that account for
                    the overlap in the two categories, such as a Venn Diagram</li>

                <li>It would seem that the author is trying to convey information about Americans'
                    preference for particular types of pies by using a more "original" pie chart design
                    and playing off the whole "pie" idea</li>
                <li>This visualization may be fun to look at, since it uses images of actual pies
                    for a pie chart, but the actual represented data is hugely problematic</li>
                <li>The percentages do not add to 100, ostensibly because people "were asked to
                    rank their three favorite types of pie;" however, that makes this pie chart
                    both confusing and essentially useless, since pie charts are best used to portray
                    percentages as they relate to a whole</li>
                <li>While the pie images are cute to look at, they mess up the Data-Ink ratio, since
                    very little real information is being portrayed with too much complex imagery</li>
                <li>This visualization would be much improved if the documented "favorite types of
                    pie" included only the top choice of those surveys - this would ensure that the
                    percentages add to 100, and is more useful information than knowing people's
                    top three flavors</li>
